long bpf_redirect_map(struct bpf_map *map, u32 key, u64 flags)

              Description
                     Redirect the packet to the endpoint referenced by
                     map at index key. Depending on its type, this map
                     can contain references to net devices (for
                     forwarding packets through other ports), or to CPUs
                     (for redirecting XDP frames to another CPU; but
                     this is only implemented for native XDP (with
                     driver support) as of this writing).

                     The lower two bits of flags are used as the return
                     code if the map lookup fails. This is so that the
                     return value can be one of the XDP program return
                     codes up to XDP_TX, as chosen by the caller. Any
                     higher bits in the flags argument must be unset.

                     See also bpf_redirect(), which only supports
                     redirecting to an ifindex, but doesn't require a
                     map to do so.

              Return XDP_REDIRECT on success, or the value of the two
                     lower bits of the flags argument on error.
